 Instructions for setting up and running the project efficiently:

1. Install JDK 21.0.1: Ensure you have JDK 21.0.1 installed.

2. Download the Project (BlinkStep).

3. Install "e(fx)clipse:
   - Open Eclipse -> Help -> Eclipse Marketplace.
   - Type “fx” in Find textbox and click on “Go” to search.
   - Select “e(fx)clipse X.Y.Z” and press “install” » X.Y.Z is the released version of e(fx)clipse.
   - From now, we can see “JavaFX” category when you select “new” to create a project.

4. Download JavaFX SDK:
   - Download JavaFX SDK from [GluonHQ](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
   - You need to select your platform to find the right SDK version for your environment.
   - Place the decompressed folder to your local directory, such as creating a “JavaFX SDK” folder.
   - Create a “JavaFX-SDK” folder in the local computer and place decompressed version into the folder.

5. Create User Library for JavaFX in Eclipse:
   - Eclipse -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> User Libraries
   - Crreate a New “User Library” and name it as “JavaFX”
   - Press “Add External JARs” and select all .jar from “lib” Add all .jars from “JavaFX SDK -> lib” 
     folder

6. Configure JavaFX Project:
  - Right click project -> Properties -> Java Build Path
  - In Libraries tab:
        » click “Classpath”
        » select “Add Library ...” button
        » choose “User Library”
        » choose “JavaFX” -> “Finish” -> “Apply” -> “Apply and Close”
        » At this moment, all errors should be gone.


7. Add other External JARs such as javax.json and gmapsfx jars:
   - Go to Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Classpath.
   - Click "Add External JARs" and add all .jar files from the "libs/" folder in the BlinkStep project.
   - Click 'Apply and Close'.

7. Configure Run Configuration:
   - Right-click on the project, select Run As -> Run Configurations.
   - Click on "+" to add a new Run Configuration.
   - Name it "main".
   - In the Arguments tab -> VM Arguments, paste:
     ```
     --module-path your_path/to/lib (Example :  /Users/nikithakambhampati/Desktop/Semester/PSA/JavaFX_SDK/lib)
     --add-modules=javafx.swing,javafx.graphics,javafx.fxml,javafx.media,javafx.web
     --add-reads javafx.graphics=ALL-UNNAMED
     --add-opens javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.charts=ALL-UNNAMED
     --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio=ALL-UNNAMED
     --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio.common=ALL-UNNAMED
     --add-opens javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED
     --add-opens javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.runtime=ALL-UNNAMED
     ```
   - Uncheck all checkboxes under the VM arguments.

8. Run the Program:
   - Go to MapApp.java and run the program as Java Application.

By following these steps, you should be able to efficiently set up and run the project in Eclipse.
